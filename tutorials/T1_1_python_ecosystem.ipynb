    "We will use [NGLViewer](http://nglviewer.org/ngl/api/index.html) for interactive visualisation of atomic cells in the notebooks. You can use your mouse to:\n",
    "- Translation: right click + drag\n",
    "- Rotation: left click + drag\n",
    "- Z-axis rotation: Ctrl + right click + drag\n",
    "- Zoom: scroll wheel\n",
    "- Center view: left click on the desired atom (or its representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also represent distances by following this procedure:\n",
    "- Right click on a single atom. You will see a green sphere wrapping it.\n",
    "- Double right click on another atom. You will see a dashed line between the two atoms, along with the reported distance in Ã….\n",
    "To remove a distance representation, repeat the sequence on the same atoms.\n",

    "[Open visualisation tool OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) can be used to look at atomic configurations. One can use `ase.io.write()` function to save the configuration as `.xyz` file and import it to OVITO. The advantage is that OVITO has a number of analysis tools."
